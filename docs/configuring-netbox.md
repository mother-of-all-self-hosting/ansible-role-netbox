# Setting up Ghostfolio

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [Ghostfolio](https://ghostfol.io/) to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

Ghostfolio is a free software for wealth management to keep track of assets such as stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.

See the project's [documentation](https://ghostfol.io/en/features) to learn what Ghostfolio does and why it might be useful to you.

## Prerequisites

To run a Ghostfolio instance it is necessary to prepare a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server and [Redis](https://redis.io/) database for managing cache data.

If you are looking for Ansible roles for them, you can check out [ansible-role-postgres](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-postgres) and [ansible-role-redis](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-redis), both of which are maintained by the [Mother-of-All-Self-Hosting (MASH)](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting) team. The role for [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) ([ansible-role-valkey](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-valkey)) is available as well.

Refer to [this section](https://github.com/ghostfolio/ghostfolio/blob/main/README.md#technology-stack) on the official documentation to check server requirements.

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable Ghostfolio with this role, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file.

**Note**: the path should be something like `inventory/host_vars/mash.example.com/vars.yml` if you use the [MASH Ansible playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook).

```yaml
########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# ghostfolio                                                           #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################

ghostfolio_enabled: true

########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# /ghostfolio                                                          #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################
```

### Set the hostname

To enable the Ghostfolio instance you need to set the hostname as well. To do so, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file. Make sure to replace `example.com` with your own value.

```yaml
ghostfolio_hostname: "example.com"
```

After adjusting the hostname, make sure to adjust your DNS records to point the domain to your server.

**Note**: hosting Ghostfolio under a subpath (by configuring the `ghostfolio_path_prefix` variable) does not seem to be possible due to Ghostfolio's technical limitations.

### Set access token salt and JWT secret key

You also need to set random strings to salt for access token and JWT secret key. They can be generated with `pwgen -s 64 1` or in another way.

```yaml
ghostfolio_environment_variable_access_token_salt: RANDOM_ACCESS_TOKEN_SALT_HERE
ghostfolio_environment_variable_jwt_secret_key: RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_HERE
```

### Configuring database

#### Set variables for the database server

To have the Ghostfolio instance connect to your Postgres server, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file.

```yaml
ghostfolio_database_username: YOUR_POSTGRES_SERVER_USERNAME_HERE
ghostfolio_database_password: YOUR_POSTGRES_SERVER_PASSWORD_HERE
ghostfolio_database_name: YOUR_POSTGRES_SERVER_DATABASE_NAME_HERE
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your own values.

#### Configuring connection to the database server (optional)

By default the role is configured to establish connection with the Postgres server via the Unix socket. You can mount the Unix socket by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
# Specify the path to the Postgres Unix socket path on the host (bind-mount source)
ghostfolio_database_socket_path_host: ""
```

Setting it enables to connect to the Postgres server via Unix socket mounted in the container at `/run-postgres/.s.PGSQL.5432`.

If TCP connection is preferred, connection via the Unix socket can be disabled by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
# Disable the connection to Postgres server via a Unix socket
ghostfolio_database_socket_enabled: false

ghostfolio_database_hostname: YOUR_POSTGRES_SERVER_HOSTNAME_HERE
ghostfolio_database_port: 5432
```

### Configure a Redis database

It is necessary to set up a Redis database for the Ghostfolio instance. Valkey can also be used instead.

To enable the Redis database for Ghostfolio, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
ghostfolio_redis_hostname: YOUR_REDIS_SERVER_HOSTNAME_HERE
ghostfolio_redis_password: YOUR_REDIS_SERVER_PASSWORD_HERE
ghostfolio_redis_port: 6379
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_REDIS_SERVER_HOSTNAME_HERE` and `YOUR_REDIS_SERVER_PASSWORD_HERE` with your own values.

### Set Coingecko API keys (optional)

If you have either or both of *CoinGecko* Demo API key and *CoinGecko* Pro API key, you can specify them by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
ghostfolio_environment_variable_api_key_coingecko_demo: YOUR_DEMO_KEY_HERE
ghostfolio_environment_variable_api_key_coingecko_pro: YOUR_PRO_KEY_HERE
```

### Extending the configuration

There are some additional things you may wish to configure about the service.

Take a look at:

- [`defaults/main.yml`](../defaults/main.yml) for some variables that you can customize via your `vars.yml` file. You can override settings (even those that don't have dedicated playbook variables) using the `ghostfolio_environment_variables_additional_variables` variable

See its [environment variables](https://ghostfol.io/docs/self-hosting/environment-variables) for a complete list of Ghostfolio's config options that you can put in `ghostfolio_environment_variables_additional_variables`.

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run the installation command of your playbook as below:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,start
```

If you use the MASH playbook, the shortcut commands with the [`just` program](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

## Usage

After running the command for installation, Ghostfolio becomes available at the specified hostname like `https://example.com`.

To use it, open the URL `https://example.com/en/register` on a web browser and create a first user by clicking the "Create Account" button. **Note that the first user will be an administrator of the instance.**

After creating the user and logging in to the instance, you can add bank and brokerage accounts by following the instruction on the UI.

See "Resources" (available at `https://example.com/en/resources`) for details about how to use Ghostfolio.

### Disable signup (optional)

As **registration is open to anyone by default**, you also would probably want to disable the signup form on "Admin Control" page. You can open the page from the header of the UI; it is also available at `https://example.com/en/admin`.

## Troubleshooting

### Check the service's logs

You can find the logs in [systemd-journald](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-journald.service.html) by logging in to the server with SSH and running `journalctl -fu ghostfolio` (or how you/your playbook named the service, e.g. `mash-ghostfolio`).
