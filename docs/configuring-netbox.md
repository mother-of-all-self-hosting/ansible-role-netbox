# Setting up NetBox

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [NetBox](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/) to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

NetBox is an open-source web application that provides [IP address management (IPAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_management) and [data center infrastructure management (DCIM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center_management#Data_center_infrastructure_management) functionality.

See the project's [documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/) to learn what NetBox does and why it might be useful to you.

## Prerequisites

To run a NetBox instance it is necessary to prepare a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server and [Redis](https://redis.io/) database for managing cache data.

If you are looking for Ansible roles for them, you can check out [ansible-role-postgres](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-postgres) and [ansible-role-redis](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-redis), both of which are maintained by the [Mother-of-All-Self-Hosting (MASH)](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting) team. The role for [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) ([ansible-role-valkey](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-valkey)) is available as well.

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable NetBox with this role, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file.

**Note**: the path should be something like `inventory/host_vars/mash.example.com/vars.yml` if you use the [MASH Ansible playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook).

```yaml
########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# netbox                                                               #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################

netbox_enabled: true

########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# /netbox                                                              #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################
```

### Set the hostname

To enable the NetBox instance you need to set the hostname as well. To do so, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file. Make sure to replace `example.com` with your own value.

```yaml
netbox_hostname: "example.com"
```

After adjusting the hostname, make sure to adjust your DNS records to point the domain to your server.

### Set a random string

You also need to set a random string to the variable as below by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file. The value can be generated with `pwgen -s 64 1` or in another way.

```yaml
netbox_environment_variable_secret_key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
```

### Set variables for the database server

To have the NetBox instance connect to your Postgres server, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file.

```yaml
netbox_database_hostname: YOUR_POSTGRES_SERVER_HOSTNAME_HERE
netbox_database_port: 5432
netbox_database_username: YOUR_POSTGRES_SERVER_USERNAME_HERE
netbox_database_password: YOUR_POSTGRES_SERVER_PASSWORD_HERE
netbox_database_name: YOUR_POSTGRES_SERVER_DATABASE_NAME_HERE
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your own values.

### Configure a Redis database

It is necessary to set up a Redis database for the NetBox instance. Valkey can also be used instead.

To enable the Redis database for NetBox, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
netbox_redis_hostname: YOUR_REDIS_SERVER_HOSTNAME_HERE
netbox_redis_port: 6379
netbox_redis_username: YOUR_REDIS_SERVER_USERNAME_HERE
netbox_redis_password: YOUR_REDIS_SERVER_PASSWORD_HERE
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your own values.

### Set details for the admin user

You can create an instance's admin user by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file. Make sure to replace values with your own ones.

```yaml
netbox_environment_variable_superuser_name: ADMIN_USERNAME_HERE
netbox_environment_variable_superuser_email: ADMIN_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE
netbox_environment_variable_superuser_password: ADMIN_PASSWORD_HERE
```

Generating a strong password (e.g. `pwgen -s 64 1`) is recommended for `netbox_environment_variable_superuser_password`.

>[!NOTE]
> Subsequent changes to the password will not affect an existing user's password.

### Configuring Single-Sign-On (SSO) integration

NetBox supports different [remote authentication](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/configuration/remote-authentication/) backends, including those provided by the [Python Social Auth](https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/) library. This library is included in the NetBox container image by default, so you can invoke any [backend](https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-core/tree/master/social_core/backends) provided by it.

Each module's Python file contains detailed information about how to configure it. It should be noted that module-specific configuration is passed as Python configuration (via `netbox_configuration_extra_python`), and **not as environment variables**.

#### Keycloak

To integrate with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
netbox_environment_variables_additional_variables: |
  REMOTE_AUTH_ENABLED=True
  REMOTE_AUTH_BACKEND=social_core.backends.keycloak.KeycloakOAuth2

  # Space-separated names of groups that new users will be assigned to.
  # These groups must be created manually (from the Admin panel's Groups section) before use.
  REMOTE_AUTH_DEFAULT_GROUPS=

netbox_configuration_extra_python: |
  # These need to match your Client app information in Keycloak. See below
  SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_KEY = ''
  SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_SECRET = ''

  # The value for this is retrieved from Keycloak -> Realm Settings -> Keys tab -> Public key button for RS256
  SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_PUBLIC_KEY = ''

  # The value for these are retrieved from Keycloak -> Realm Settings -> General tab -> OpenID Endpoint Configuration button
  SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_AUTHORIZATION_URL = 'https://KEYCLOAK_URL/realms/REALM_IDENTIFIER/protocol/openid-connect/auth'
  SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL = 'https://KEYCLOAK_URL/realms/REALM_IDENTIFIER/protocol/openid-connect/token'

# If Keycloak is running on the same server, uncomment the lines below
# and replace HOSTNAME with the hostname of the Keycloak server (e.g. mash.example.com or keycloak.example.com).
# netbox_container_extra_arguments:
#  - --add-host=HOSTNAME:{{ ansible_host }}
```

The Client app needs to be created and configured in a special way on the Keycloak side by:

- activating **Client authentication**
- **Valid redirect URIs**: `https://NETBOX_URL/oauth/complete/keycloak/`
- **Web origins**: `https://NETBOX_URL/`
- in **Advanced**, changing the following settings:
  - **Request object signature algorithm** = `RS256`
  - **User info signed response algorithm** = `RS256`
- in **Client scopes** (for this Client app via the **Client scopes** tab, not for all apps via the left-most menu), configure the `*-dedicated` scope (e.g. `netbox-dedicated` if you named your Client app `netbox`) and in the **Mappers** tab, click **Configure a new mapper** add a new **Audience** mapper with the following settings:
  - **Name** = anything you like (e.g. `netbox-audience`)
  - **Included Client Audience** = the key of this Client app (e.g. `netbox`)
  - **Add to access token** = On

Refer to [this page](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/configuration/remote-authentication/) on the NetBox documentation for additional environment variables controlling groups and permissions for new users (like `REMOTE_AUTH_DEFAULT_GROUPS`).

### Extending the configuration

There are some additional things you may wish to configure about the service.

Take a look at:

- [`defaults/main.yml`](../defaults/main.yml) for some variables that you can customize via your `vars.yml` file. You can override settings (even those that don't have dedicated playbook variables) using the `netbox_environment_variables_additional_variables` variable

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run the installation command of your playbook as below:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,start
```

If you use the MASH playbook, the shortcut commands with the [`just` program](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

## Usage

After running the command for installation, NetBox becomes available at the specified hostname like `https://example.com`.

To get started, open the URL with a web browser to log in to the instance. You can log in with the username (not email address) and password specified with the `netbox_environment_variable_superuser_*` variables.

## Troubleshooting

### Check the service's logs

You can find the logs in [systemd-journald](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-journald.service.html) by logging in to the server with SSH and running `journalctl -fu netbox` (or how you/your playbook named the service, e.g. `mash-netbox`).
